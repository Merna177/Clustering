# Clustering
Clustering using Kmeans 
is a AI project to learn clustering algorithm on any dataset(images)
so one of data set was cifar i used but kmeans not the best choic for cifar dataset as it's accuracy 40%
cifar dataset need deep learning algorithm.
but we use kmeans as it was an assignment to learn this algorithm
